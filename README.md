### Abstract

The North Carolina mask ban, as outlined in NC HB 237, is set to have profound implications on marginalized communities. This legislation, which prohibits the use of masks in public spaces, could exacerbate existing health disparities among these populations. Historically, marginalized groups have faced significant barriers to healthcare access and higher rates of health-related issues. By restricting mask usage, the policy may increase the vulnerability of these communities to communicable diseases, particularly in pandemic situations. Furthermore, the ban could lead to increased stigmatization and social exclusion of individuals within these groups who rely on masks for protection, potentially leading to greater economic and social inequities. 

Access to protective measures like masks is crucial for public health, especially during pandemics. This project aims to highlight the anticipated disproportionate effects of the mask ban on these already vulnerable populations, underscoring the need for careful consideration and mitigation strategies to protect public health and human rights. For this analysis, we will use publicly available data to investigate how the mask ban policy intersects with the demographics and socioeconomic status of affected populations.

Research Question: How is the NC mask ban going to affect the immunocompromised people living in NC?
