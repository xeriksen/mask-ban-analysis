### Abstract

The mask ban policy has significant implications for marginalized populations. This project aims to examine the effects of the mask ban on these communities, focusing on the potential health, social, and economic impacts. Systematic practices such as economic segregation, racial discrimination, and inadequate access to healthcare have exacerbated the challenges faced by marginalized groups during the implementation of mask bans. 

Access to protective measures like masks is crucial for public health, especially during pandemics. The mask ban may disproportionately affect communities of color and economically disadvantaged populations, who are already at higher risk of adverse health outcomes. For this analysis, we will use publicly available data to investigate how the mask ban policy intersects with the demographics and socioeconomic status of affected populations.
